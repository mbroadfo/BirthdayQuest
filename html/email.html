    <h3>First Word of Power</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
        “Libraries are not created. They grow.”<br>
        Seek the building whose very stones declare this.<br>
        Its soaring windows and arches welcome seekers of knowledge.<br>
        Above its entrance, carved in stone, a word waits — one that marks both this place and your own path.<br>
        Claim this word.
    </p>

    <h3>Second Word of Power</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
        Another house of stories waits within the campus you know so well.<br>
        Its walls are newer, but within them, wisdom from many traditions finds voice.<br>
        Look up, and you will see a message — drawn from the lore of a people who understand the power of light and stories shared.<br>
        Consider the phrase carefully. One word among them will resonate with your calling.<br>
        You will know it when you see it.
    </p>

    <h3>Third Word of Power</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
        Not all adventures begin with a turning page.<br>
        Sometimes they begin with a well-steeped cup.<br>
        Seek the place nearby where your passion for tea would feel at home — a shop whose name offers a bright, unmistakable word.<br>
        That word is your third Word of Power.
